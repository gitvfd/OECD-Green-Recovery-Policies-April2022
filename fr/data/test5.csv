EST1,EST,Other or not specified,,Multiple or n.a.,,Climate Mitigation,Air Pollution,Other,"According to Prime Minister Jüri Ratas: ""By 2050, Estonia will support the goal of climate neutrality across the European Union. The green agreement gives us a way to reach this goal. It is a framework that covers almost all policy areas, with a strong emphasis on social and economic issues in addition to environmental issues."" According to the Minister of the Environment Rene Koka, the green agreement will bring several opportunities for Estonia. “It is in our interest to move with innovation and find new perspectives for increasing the competitiveness of Estonian companies, increasing the volume of investments and opportunities for the transition to renewable energy. One important area for Estonia is the development of hydrogen and other renewable energy and fuel-based technologies. In my opinion, hydrogen is definitely one of the solutions of the future, and I believe that in ten years' time, hydrogen solutions could work very successfully both in Estonia and in Europe, ""said Kokk. Estonia supports the establishment of a long-term climate neutrality framework across the European Union in 2050 in European climate law. At the same time, increasing the European Union's 2030 climate target must be preceded by a thorough analysis of Member States and sectors. According to Estonia, the energy and transport sectors need the most investments, as it is important to ensure energy security and security of supply in the transition to climate neutrality. Estonia sees great potential, for example, in offshore wind farms, which is a good opportunity for greater use of renewable energy in the Nordic-Baltic region. There is also a need to support the development of innovative solutions, the development of green technologies and basic and applied research. The focus should also be on the implementation and use of future technologies and the development of the necessary skills. Estonia also emphasizes the importance of environmental education and the fact-based treatment of green issues. Estonia's position also points out that the initial European Green Agreement action plan published in December would also take into account the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects. However, exit activities must be in line with the EU's long-term climate goals and the principles of the circular economy. At the moment, the EU and International Co-operation Department of Ministry of Environment of Estonia cannot point to a more detailed action plan.

The objective is to increase the modal share of rail in freight from the current level of 27 per cent to 45 per cent. Innovative financing has been devised to fund these priority projects.

The government announces a massive infrastructure investment plan conceptualised as part of the country’s strategy to revitalize the economy and reduce rampant unemployment. The COVID-19 pandemic and the downgrading of the economy already before the pandemic increased the urgent need for infrastructure investment. 
The ""greenness"" of the measure has not been explicitly defined. Among the sectors of intervention - energy, water and sanitation, transport, digital infrastructure, human settlements, and agriculture and agroprocessing, energy is the one that most explicitly refers to sustainable resources with the continuation of the Integrated Resource Plan (project started in 2019).

Cabinet approved key actions that will contribute to the environment:
1. Establishment of the Presidential Climate Change Coordinating Commission (PCCCC) to coordinate the Just Transition. One of its first tasks will be to focus on understanding the impact of climate change on jobs, both positive and negative, and climate change responses by sector and location. This will require the urgent finalisation of the National Employment Vulnerability Assessment (NEVA) and thereafter, Sector Job Resilient Plans (SJRPs). The Commission will also explore opportunities for new upstream and downstream green jobs and green industries that should be exploited, and climate resilience interventions that need to be expanded.
2. South Africa’s Low Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS), also approved by Cabinet, will be deposited with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Secretariat.  This is further to the country’s NDC deposited with the UNFCCC ahead of the signing of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in which countries committed to limited the increase in global average temperatures to below 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
